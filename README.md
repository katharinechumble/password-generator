## About
A simple tool to create a randomly generated password comprised of letters, numbers, and special characters.  During coding, multiple attempts were made to get the code to work, however despite consulting numerous resources, certain elements remain "undefined" per the console which prevents the generator from working.  I think the issue lies in and around the button, however, where the element refuses to become interactive.
